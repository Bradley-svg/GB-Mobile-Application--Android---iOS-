# Build Progress Report 0.2.0

- 0.2.x fleet visibility & search: backend now scores health (`healthy|warning|critical|offline`) from last_seen + alerts/status and returns `health`/`last_seen` on `/sites`, `/sites/:id`, `/sites/:id/devices`, and the new `/fleet?q=&health=&tag=` search endpoint. Mobile Dashboard shows fleet health counters/recency, Search is reachable from the Dashboard search bar (online uses `/fleet`, offline replays cached results), Site devices render compact rows with health/last-seen plus quick actions, and Dashboard/Site/Device/Alerts show “Data older than 24 hours – may be out of date” when cache is stale. To exercise: run backend + mobile dev client, log in as the demo user, use the Dashboard search bar to open Search (try health chips and offline mode), open a Site to use the quick-action icons, and toggle offline/older caches to see freshness banners.
