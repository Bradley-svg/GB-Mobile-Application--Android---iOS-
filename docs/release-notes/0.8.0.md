# Release 0.8.0

## What's new
- Versioning aligned across backend/mobile with `APP_VERSION` surfaced on `/health-plus`, Expo `version`/`versionCode`/`buildNumber` bumped, and release helper scripts (`release:check`, `release:tag`) ready for tagging.
- Security/auth: login rate limiting with IP/username lockout, password reset flow, TOTP 2FA setup/confirm/disable plus login challenges, and refresh/session rotation recorded via audit and `/health-plus`.
- Device experience: dashboard gauges, compressor history card with vendor range caps and disabled handling, combined alert/work order device timeline, and diagnostics cards wired to `/health-plus`.
- Operations/observability: `/health-plus` reports DB/storage/AV latency, vendor disable flags, push readiness, and heat-pump history freshness; dev-all orchestration runs backend + Metro + emulator together; staging bootstrap script seeds a demo org/user/device.
- Push & QR: Expo push (alerts/test) with navigation metadata, role-gated push registration/test routes, and QR-based device lookup with org/RBAC enforcement.

## Breaking changes
- None expected; APIs and RBAC are unchanged. 2FA remains opt-in but enforced for `owner,admin` when enabled.

## Known limitations
- Password reset emails still require an external provider; the backend only issues tokens.
- Expo push delivery depends on a configured `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` per environment; health-check pushes remain optional.
- Heat-pump history may be disabled in staging/CI; compressor history will show a clear unavailable state in that case.
- Mobile focus is Android dev client/emulator; iOS builds have not been exercised for this release candidate.
