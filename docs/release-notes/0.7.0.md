# Release 0.7.0

## What's new
- Unified versioning across backend and mobile surfaced via `/health-plus` and Expo config.
- Auth hardening remains on by default: login rate limiting with IP/username lockout, password reset flows, and TOTP 2FA setup/confirm/disable plus 2FA challenge handling.
- Device experience: dashboard gauges, compressor history with range caps, and combined alert/work order timeline on device detail.
- Operational visibility: `/health-plus` with slow-query logging, vendor disable flags, AV/storage/db latency, and downsampled telemetry history.
- Safety and distribution: antivirus scanning with signed file URLs, audit events for sensitive actions, Expo push alerts/test payloads with navigation metadata, and QR-based device lookup with org/RBAC checks.
- Release helpers: `npm run release:check` (lint/type/tests + Android e2e; skip the e2e leg locally if your emulator is unavailable) and `npm run release:tag` to print the suggested git tag.

## Breaking changes
- None expected for existing clients; APIs and RBAC remain stable.

## Known limitations
- Password reset emails still require an external provider; the backend only issues tokens.
- Expo push delivery depends on a configured `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` per environment.
- Heat-pump history may be disabled in staging/CI; compressor history will show a clear unavailable state when vendor calls are off.
- Mobile priority is Android dev client/emulator; iOS builds have not been exercised in this release candidate.
